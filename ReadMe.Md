A Vedic multiplier is composed by
utilizing Urdhava Triyagbhayam sutra and the
viper outline is finished by utilizing reversible
rationale door. Reversible rationales are likewise
the major prerequisite for the developing field of
Quantum processing. The Vedic multiplier is
utilized for the increase unit in order to lessen
incomplete items and to get leading and smaller
range .The reversible rationale is utilized to get less
power. The MAC is outlined in Verilog HDL and
the reproduction is done in Modelsim, Xilinx 14.2
and blend is finished in both RTL compiler utilizing
rhythm and also Xilinx. The chip outline for the
proposed MAC is additionally done.

The following are the code and the functionalities in Verilog.
